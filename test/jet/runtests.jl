# A package whose public surface is DynamicPPL `@model` functions gets spurious
# JET reports for every `~`/`:=` line (the tilde macro hides the assignment from
# JET). To suppress exactly those, drop a package-owned `test/jet/jet_config.jl`
# that defines `JET_REPORT_FILTER` (a `report -> Bool` predicate; a report is
# kept when it returns `true`). `EpiAwarePackageTools.dynamicppl_model_filter`
# is the ready-made filter for `@model` packages. Without the config the runner
# fails on any report (the strict default).
