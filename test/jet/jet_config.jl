# PACKAGE-OWNED — scaffold writes this once and never overwrites it.
#
# Optional JET configuration for the isolated runner (test/jet/runtests.jl). If
# this file defines `JET_REPORT_FILTER` (a `report -> Bool` predicate; a report
# is kept when it returns `true`), the runner switches from `test_package` to
# `report_package` + filter and fails only on reports the predicate keeps.
#
# The common need is a DynamicPPL `@model` package: JET emits a false
# `UndefVarErrorReport` for every `~`-assigned local (and `MethodErrorReport`s
# through the `:=` tracker), because the tilde macro hides the assignment from
# JET's static analysis. Uncomment the line below to drop exactly those:
#
# const JET_REPORT_FILTER = dynamicppl_model_filter
#
# Or write your own predicate. Leaving this file with no `JET_REPORT_FILTER`
# keeps the strict default (fail on any report).
