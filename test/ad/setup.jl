# AD-harness driver. Wires the shared EpiAwarePackageTools AD harness to the
# package's own AD-fixture registry (`ADFixtures` by convention), then exposes
# `test_working_backend` / `test_partial_backend` / `check_broken` as thin
# locals the scenario test items call. The registry — the actual scenarios,
# backend list, and broken/skip bookkeeping — is PACKAGE-OWNED (see
# `test/ad/scenarios.jl` and the package's `test/ADFixtures` registry); only
# this wiring is standard.
#
# This file is force-managed: `scaffold_update()` overwrites it with the generic driver
# on every sync. A package whose ADFixtures registry predates the current
# `ADRegistry` contract (its `scenarios` does not accept `category`) can keep a
# package-owned driver while it migrates by adding the opt-out marker described
# in `EpiAwarePackageTools.scaffold_update`'s docstring (kit #162); `scaffold_update()` then
# preserves this file instead of clobbering it.
