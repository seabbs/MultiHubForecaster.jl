# Package-specific configuration read by the managed `make.jl`. It drives the
# Literate.jl tutorial pipeline and the README/index link rewrites, and lists
# the linkcheck URLs to ignore. The defaults below build a site with no
# tutorials, so a fresh package needs no edits here; fill these in as the docs
# grow. CensoredDistributions.jl's `docs/make.jl` is a worked example of the
# values these consts take.

# Tutorial source `.jl` files (Literate scripts) under `TUTORIALS_SUBDIR`.
#
# Light tutorials emit `@example` blocks that Documenter runs in-process; keep
# cheap tutorials here.

# resolve in a fast build.

# `benchmarks` flag the package was scaffolded with; `false` drops the page
# and `make.jl` also omits its `pages.jl` nav entry. The trend plot needs

# in runtime/memory counts as a regression; raise it for a noisier benchmark
