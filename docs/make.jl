# MANAGED by EpiAwarePackageTools.scaffold — do not edit by hand.
#
# Thin entry point for the standard EpiAware documentation build. All build
# logic lives in `EpiAwarePackageTools.DocsBuild.build_docs` (versioned +
# tested in the kit); this file only wires the package-owned `pages.jl` +
# `docs_config.jl` into that call, so it can be re-applied on every `scaffold_update`
# without losing package content.
#
# `build_docs`:
#   - runs the Literate tutorial pipeline (light in-process, heavy one per
#     subprocess) driven by `docs_config.jl`; under `--skip-notebooks` the
#     light tutorials still render in-process (cheap) and only the heavy ones
#     fall back to fast-build heading stubs; independent of that flag, any
#     `FORCE_STUB_TUTORIALS` entry always renders from its heading stub
#     without running, while its heavy siblings still execute normally,
#   - generates `src/index.md` from the README (badges stripped, any
#     `INDEX_STRIP_SECTIONS` removed, link rewrites applied),
#   - generates `src/release-notes.md` from a project-root `NEWS.md`,
#   - generates `src/benchmarks.md` (a tight skeleton + the package-owned
#     `docs/benchmarks.md` prose hook + the rendered performance history),
#   - generates the API pages from the module's documented bindings, and
#   - renders + deploys with DocumenterVitepress.
#
# Build it with `task docs` (or `julia --project=docs docs/make.jl`).

# The docs navigation tree (`pages.jl`) and package-specific build config
# (`docs_config.jl`: tutorial lists, README/index link rewrites, named-section
# strips, linkcheck ignores). Both are package-owned — written on `scaffold`,
# never re-applied by `scaffold_update` — so an adopter predating either file has none.
# Guard the include so a re-applied managed `make.jl` still loads and falls
# back to defaults (#163) rather than erroring on a missing file; `_cfg` then
# defaults every key a missing or older config predates. The fallback warns
# because a build that silently defaults `pages` publishes a Home-only
# navigation, which a green docs run would otherwise hide (#188).
